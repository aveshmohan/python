    #1.Write a Python program to display the first and last colors from the following list
# list=['blue','red','yellow','black']
# first=list[0]
# last=list[3]
# print(first,last)

#2 Write a Python program to sum two given integers. However, if the sum is between 15 and 20 it will return 20.

# def fun(a,b):
#     total=a+b
#     print(total)
#
#     if total>15 and total<20:
#         return 20
#     else:
#         return 0
# r=fun(10,20)
# print(r)

# 3..Write a program that prints all the even numbers from 1 to 20
# for i in range(1,11):
#     if i%2==0:
#         print(i)

#4. Write a program to print the cube of all numbers from 1 to a given number
# given=int(input('enter a number'))
# for i in range(given):
#      cube=i*3
#      print(cube)




# 5. Create a program that asks the user for numbers until they enter a negative number. Print the sum of all the
# positive numbers entered by the user, terminating the loop when a negative number is entered using a break statement
# num=int(input('enter a number'))
# if num<0:
#     exit
# else:
